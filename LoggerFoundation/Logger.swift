/// Integrated Logging Component with various logging functions.
/// To use one of the public log functions, you can follow the structure provided in the code.
///
/// Here's an example of how you might use the log function with a message:
/// ```swift
/// Logger.log(.info, msg: "This is an informational log message.")
/// ```
/// In this example, the log level is set to `.info`, and the log message is `"This is an informational log message."`
/// You can replace the log level and message with your specific requirements.
///
/// If you want to log an error, you can use the log function with an Error parameter:
/// ```swift
/// let someError = MyCustomError(description: "An error occurred.")
/// Logger.log(.error, error: someError)
/// ```
/// Replace `MyCustomError` with the actual type of your error, and customize the error description accordingly.
///
/// ## Interceptor
/// To apply an intercepter, define a simple interceptor conforming to the Interceptor protocol
/// In this example, MyCustomInterceptor is a struct that conforms to the Interceptor protocol,
/// providing its own implementation for the intercept method.
/// The interceptor simply prints the log level and message to the console,
/// but you can customize it to perform any actions you need.
/// ```swift
/// struct MyCustomInterceptor: Interceptor {
///     func intercept(level: Logger.Level, message: String, date: Date, file: String, line: Int, method: String) {
///         // Customize the interceptor behavior
///         print("Interceptor: \(level) - \(message)")
///         // You can perform additional actions based on the log information
///         // For example, you might want to log to a specific file or send logs to a server.
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// After defining your custom interceptor, you add it to the Logger using the apply function.
/// Once added, every time you call Logger.log, your custom interceptor's intercept method will be invoked along with any other interceptors that might be added.
/// ```swift
/// // Add the custom interceptor to the Logger
/// Logger.apply(interceptor: MyCustomInterceptor())
///
/// // Now, when you log using the Logger, your interceptor will be invoked
/// Logger.log(.info, msg: "This log will be intercepted by MyCustomInterceptor.")
/// ```
